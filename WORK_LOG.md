| April 5    |   9-10pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| October 9  |  9:25-9:35  |                      Attempted to write an O(n) solution by iterating through each character and keeping an index of both the current position in the word and the position in the pattern we are looking for. Some tests do not pass :( Will have to debug and find out why. |
| October 13 | 21:10-21:40 | Tried figuring out why some of my tests didn't work... Decided one fix I would implement was making it case-independent, so I just ended up reformatting everything into bytes, a much smaller format than chars. Converting everything to bytes was slower and not worth it. |
