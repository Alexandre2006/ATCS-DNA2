| October 9  |  9:25-9:35  |                      Attempted to write an O(n) solution by iterating through each character and keeping an index of both the current position in the word and the position in the pattern we are looking for. Some tests do not pass :( Will have to debug and find out why. |
| October 13 | 21:10-21:40 | Tried figuring out why some of my tests didn't work... Decided one fix I would implement was making it case-independent, so I just ended up reformatting everything into bytes, a much smaller format than chars. Converting everything to bytes was slower and not worth it. |
| October 13 | 21:40-22:10 |                                                                                                      Found one of the issues (involving false termination when there is the same letter more than once in a row in the STR). Partially fixed. Will continue working on a fix. |
| October 13 | 22:10-22:40 |                                                                                           Found solution! STRPosition was not being updated to reflect the work being done when avoiding a false negative due to repeating letters. All tests pass, and are well within time. |
| October 21 | 14:30-15:00 |                                       Started working on a solution which uses hashing. Built a hasher class and a DNA Sequence class which converts the DNA sequence into a slightly smaller object, with only 4 possible characters instead of all of the ascii characters. |
| October 22 | 17:50-18:20 |                                                                                                                                       Finished all classes (hash and sequence) and put code together to calculate longest repetition. it doesn't work. will work on it later. |
| October 22 | 18:20-18:50 |                                                                                                                                             Fixed many bugs that cased negatives! Also removed converting the string into DNA Sequence as it absolutely killed performance :( |
| October 22 | 18:50-19:10 |                Fixed bug that caused incorrect calculation of hash... i just did a stupid math mistake... may have reversed order of powers. Also added power recalculation since it is inefficient to recalculate the powers each time. Much easier to just save the powers. |
